# Pipeline
This pipeline copies and stores the raw Graph API data to stage 1 storage in JSON format. 

The tutorial explaining how to set up a pipeline to extract your own data or how to use this pipeline template, can be found [here](https://github.com/cstohlmann/oea-graph-api/blob/main/docs/documents/Graph_API_Pipeline.pdf).
