### OEA Module: Microsoft Graph API
## What Gene originally had:
# Microsoft Graph module 
> We plan to publish these assets soon - until then, here is a brief doc that describes how to create an integration pipeline and how to process the json data that is returned: Setting up a Graph API pipeline
>
> Once fully published, this module will provide:
>
> - data extraction pipelines demonstrating how to utilize Azure Data Factory to pull data from the Graph API
> - example data sets that demonstrate the json format that the data will come in
> - Synapse notebooks that demonstrate how the json data landed in stage 1 of the data lake can be processed and landed as parquet in stage 2 of the data lake
> - A simple Power BI report that demonstrates how to connect to your data lake and construct a semantic model and basic report on the data from the Graph API
