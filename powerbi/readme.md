# PowerBI template [TO BE UPDATED]

The Graph PowerBI template consists of 1 page:

1. <strong> Teams Activity</strong>: visualizes students that have used or interacted with Teams using the sample data.
 - Total Private and Aggregate Teams Messages by userPrincipleName and Audio Duration - shows the breakdown of all users' private and aggregate Teams messages, per audio duration. This shows the interaction levels within Teams for any particular user.
 - Total Meetings Attended and Scheduled by userPrincipalName - shows a comparison of how many users attended the meetings that were scheduled in Teams (by default, in this example, everyone attended the meeting that was scheduled).
