# Sample Datasets

Sample datasets provided in this module were created using the pipeline integration, landing 3 datasets into stage 1 of the data lake. The following queries were used for this example module, and utilized the beta version of Graph Reports API:
 - Microsoft Users: ``` beta/users ```
 - Microsoft 365 Applications User Detail: ``` beta/reports/getM365AppUserDetail(period='D7')/content?$format=application/json ```
 - Teams Activity User Detail: ``` beta/reports/getTeamsUserActivityUserDetail(period='D7')?$format=application/json ```

Use this dataset by downloading the "GraphAPI" folder and uploading to your Synapse environment. Follow the tutorial documentation [here](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/modules/Microsoft_Graph/docs/documents/Graph%20Reports%20API%20Tutorial.pdf) for implementing these datasets, and using them for the pipeline template provided in this Graph Reports API module.
