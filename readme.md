# OEA Module: Microsoft Graph Reports API
Microsoft Graph Reports API can provide data from Microsoft Teams and other O365 applications. Data is freely available and includes usage data from Teams, Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, and Word.

You can use this OEA Microsoft Graph Reports API module to incorporate O365 usage data into your organization's OEA data lakes.

## Problem Statement
As education systems and institutions use more digital learning platforms, services, and applications as part of the teaching and learning process, they need data on how and when students and educators are using those tools. This “usage” data can be combined with other data sources, such as assessment or financial data, to analyze the relationship between the tools, learning, and costs, for example. 

Microsoft Graph Reports API data can be used for many different education purposes:
  - Education system leader reports on level of usage of various O365 applications, including Microsoft Teams. 
     *	If combined with data from Student Information Systems, this usage data can be reported by student demographics, school rosters, or learning outcome data (SIS data not included in this module).
  -	School dashboards on which O365 apps are being used.
  -	Class dashboards for teachers to see students’ attendance in Teams Meetings and participation in chat; or student use of PowerPoint, Word, or Excel.  

Pulling data using this Graph API module provides solutions to these scenarios, as well as many more instances to extract a wide variety of activities that students engage in, while online.
  
## Module Impact 
This Microsoft Graph Reports API module for OEA will leverage the Azure Synapse environment to aid education systems in bringing this data to their own Azure data lake for analysis. This includes a pipeline for extracting digital activity from Microsoft Teams and some O365 apps, providing a more detailed and accurate representation of online teaching and learning activities. The PowerBI templates included in this module can be used by system and school leaders to show:

  - Which apps are being used across the entire O365 tenant, over time and by time of day.
     * Number of Teams meetings in the O365 tenant participated in by all users over time
     * Time of day of Teams meetings
     * Number of people per meeting
     * Number of private and Team chat messages over time and by time of day

These dashboard examples represent only data from Microsoft Teams and O365. When this data is combined with other data sources, they can illustrate how patterns of digital activity relate to learning outcomes. With such combined data, education systems can start to analyze whether new programs or interventions help to improve teaching and learning with digital tools.

The Microsoft Graph Reports API module welcomes contributions.

This module was developed by Christian Stohlmann and Chad Vidden. The architecture and reference implementation for all modules is built on Azure Synapse Analytics - with Azure Data Lake Storage as the storage backbone, and Azure Active Directory providing the role-based access control.
