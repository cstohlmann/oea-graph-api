# Microsoft Graph Reports API Module
Microsoft Graph Reports API can provide data from Microsoft Teams and other O365 applications. Data is freely available and includes usage data from Teams, Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, and Word.

You can use this OEA Microsoft Graph Reports API module to incorporate O365 usage data into your organization's OEA data lakes.

## Problem Statement and Module Impact
As education systems and institutions use more digital learning platforms, services, and applications as part of the teaching and learning process, they need data on how and when students and educators are using those tools. This “usage” data can be combined with other data sources, such as assessment or financial data, to analyze the relationship between the tools, learning, and costs, for example. 

Microsoft Graph Reports API data can be used for many different education purposes:
  - Education system leader reports on level of usage of various O365 applications, including Microsoft Teams. 
     *	If combined with data from Student Information Systems, this usage data can be reported by student demographics, school rosters, or learning outcome data (SIS data not included in this module).
  -	School dashboards on which O365 apps are being used.
  -	Class dashboards for teachers to see students’ attendance in Teams Meetings and participation in chat; or student use of PowerPoint, Word, or Excel.  

Pulling data using this Microsoft Graph Reports API module provides solutions to these scenarios, as well as many more instances to extract a wide variety of activities that students engage in, while online. 

These dashboard examples represent only data from Microsoft Teams and O365. When this data is combined with other data sources, they can illustrate how patterns of digital activity relate to learning outcomes. With such combined data, education systems can start to analyze whether new programs or interventions help to improve teaching and learning with digital tools.

</p>

<ins><strong>Preparation:</ins></strong> This module currently leans on v0.6.1 and will be updated to accommodate v0.7 of the OEA framework. Ensure you have proper [Azure subscription and credentials](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/framework) and setup [v0.6.1 of the OEA framework](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/framework#setup-of-framework-assets). This will include v0.6.1 of the [OEA python class](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/framework/synapse/notebook/OEA_py.ipynb). 

1. Import the [Graph Reports API module class notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Graph/notebook/GraphAPI_py.ipynb) into your Synapse workspace. This notebook contains data schema information and data writing functions needed to support module pipelines. 
2. Import the [Graph Reports API module pipeline template](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Graph/pipeline) into your Synapse workspace and execute the pipeline. Review the [module pipeline page](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Graph/pipeline) for understanding how to choose ingestion of K-12 or Higher Ed test data.
     * Additionally, see the [module written tutorial](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Graph/docs/Graph%20Reports%20API%20Module%20Tutorial.pdf) or [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K01h-QsMX9c) for detailed instructions.
3. Verify that the module pipeline landed data into stage 1 and 2 and SQL databases were created. See the [module pipeline page](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Graph/pipeline) for detailed instructions.
4. Download the [module Power BI template file](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Graph/powerbi). Module test data is already imported into the Power BI. See the [module Power BI page](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Graph/powerbi) page for instructions for switching the Power BI template data source to import from your Synapse workspace data source.

#### Notes:
 - Microsoft Graph Reports API is free to access, and does not require a subscription. However, if you want to pull your own usage data from O365 and Teams (which is the primary focus of this module), these will require subscriptions for your education system.
 - The above instructions will setup the OEA Microsoft Graph Reports API module using the [module test data](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Graph/test_data), but the same pipeline can be used for production data. See the [module pipeline page](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Graph/pipeline) for instructions on switching the pipeline data source to production data.

#### OEA Digital Engagement Schema:

After completing the setup of this module, the MS Graph M365 and Teams activity schemas can be transformed into the [OEA schema standard for digital engagement](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/schemas/schema_catalog/Digital_Engagement_Schema). Refer to the documentation and assets to see how this module can be extended and standardized for OEA package-use.

## Data Sources

 - The Graph Reports API data sources are used for ingesting Microsoft Teams and O365 "usage" data, as explained above. There are also additional data sources that can be ingested upon creating your own pipeline, or adding to the pipeline template provided. 
 - The data ingested can either be formatted as JSON or CSV, although the pipeline template and datasets provided utilize the JSON format. 

See the [module test data page](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Graph/test_data) for details on data format and contents.
